##Self Notes

- Strings = Number of Charactors 
- string concatination
- indentation ERROR (require for easy to read thing xD)
- PRINT AND INPUT FUNCTION
- VARIABLES (Nothing but a memory container which is used to store data (vary means it can be changed))
- Variable Naming RUELS (no starting with NUMBERS but can be at end, No space between words, DON"T USE certain reserved names )
- DATA TYPES (INT, STRING, FLOAT, BOOLEAN)
- Programmers always count from "ZERO"
- Remember 123_456_789 is 123456789 #INT DATA TYPE
- 3.14 #FLOAT DATA TYPE
-True or False #BOOLEAN DATA TYPE
-see Functions as a POTATO MACHINE 
-##Type Conversion
-str() or int() or float()
-## Mathematical Operations  --> PEMDASLR
- 3 + 5
- 3 - 5
- 5 * 2
- 6 / 3
- 6 ** 3 --> Exponent
- 6 // 5 --> Perfect Division
- += , -= , *= , /=
-## F string in Python 
-print(f"in front of double {quotes} f-string {varibale_name}") !important
-
-Python Data Structure
- PYTHON LIST (States in USA : order and queue)
-  List --> Order is Kept in List
--> It is Mutable (we can alter or add any items inside the list )
-->Nested Lists
-->list index
--> Random Module

- ##Loops in Python
- for loop -- to the list 
- for loop with range operator
- range operator --> up to but not including
<!-- - for number in range(a,b):
    print(number) -->
##Functions
- built-in functions 
-how to define function and arguments and parameters..
-function inputs 
-function outputs (returning)
-Docstrings 
##Dictionarie
-how to define dictionary
-manipulate dictionary
-nesting of dict in dict or list of dict
-key and value pair and how to access each key with its value
-print vs return 
-recursion and flags
##SCOPE
-local and global scope 
-Namespace
-There is no block scope in PYTHON (if while and for .... They dont follow )
-global CONSTANTS (Naming convensions make it CAPTALIZE)
-
##Debugging
-Bug
-breakpoints
-old debugging technique (print)


##OOP
-class  -act as a blueprint for creating objects (variables and methods)
-objects -- what things have(speed) and does (methods --> break )
-does not allocate memory when class is created but everytime when objects created it gets allocated..
- PYPI website for python predefined packages....https://pypi.org/

functions as input (without parenthesis)
HIigher order function when function can take argument as a function
object state and instances
class heritance (OOP)
slicing List and  Tuples

Files 
file modes - r,w,a
"with open ("file.txt") as file:" no need to close the file
